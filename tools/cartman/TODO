Important features
==================
 - create tickets from stdin instead of an editor (for automation).
 - return errors from the front end (html-stripped) when they reach cartman,
   not just in new.
 - keep the edited file until we know the delivery is successful, wrap the
   whole thing in a diaper and tell the user where to find the temporary file.
 - find a way to read comments (tricky because there is nothing that dumps the
   comments in their raw format in the default Trac installation).
 - find a way to automatically test the whole thing against different versions
   of trac (install, venv, commands, repeat?)
 - test the output of commands in the test suite.

Lesser features
===============
 - add paging to the search command (optional).
 - use a better module for HTML parsing (e.g. BeautifulSoup4).
 - abstract the text module behind an inheritable class, that will allow
   version specific parsing implementations.
 - add a modular backend support, could be set to:
    - http (current implementation)
    - xmlrpc (through the plugin)
    - db (direct database access, has to have access to the database)
    - direct (use the trac module, has to be on the installation machine)
 - create an alias system similar to mercurial::

    [alias]
    close = status fixed
    reopen = status reopen -m

 - improve editor handling to allow better test units
 - add query support, allowing them to be defined in the config file.
 - add curses support to navigate tickets easily.
 - write a cartman daemon that will poll a mailbox for new emails and create
   tickets from them and later allow to reply to comments, attach files, etc.
 - `status` should also return the resolution.
