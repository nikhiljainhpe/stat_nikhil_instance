### Goals
The intention is to keep image management overhead as low, and image size to a minimum
* Where possible, use one image for everything, tuning enabled services with a post-install script(s) where needed. e.g. logins, compute, lnet servers all have the same base image. However CPE and lustre mounting would be disabled on lnet servers. 
* All global configuration should go into hybrid post-install scripts, so images can easily be identical if rebuilt from an rpm list. 
* Any large shared filesystem requirements (e.g. CUDA, RoCM) should be installed on shared storage, not in the image. 

### Base and working images 
All development work is done on a base image. 
This image can be updated, and assigned to nodes for testing, but when feature complete, it should be checked in to image revision control, and copied to a working image for wide spread deployment. e.g.

```
marvin9:~ # cm image revision commit -i kaust-cos-2.5.130-cpe -m "Added sssd -230929 LM"

Image kaust-cos-2.5.130-cpe using repo group: kaust-cos-2.5.130-cpe
Â  If you wish to unset this, use cm image unset with --repo-group
