# Quick Start
## Add Users 
* Add users by running the following on the command line: 
    * If no users currently exist:
```
htpasswd -c /opt/stat/.htpasswd <USERNAME>`
```
    * For additional users: 
```
htpasswd /opt/stat/.htpasswd <USERNAME>
```
* Grant a user admin priviliges: 
```
/opt/stat/python3/bin/trac-admin /opt/stat/system permission add <USERNAME> TRAC_ADMIN
```

If granted admin privileges, goto Menu bar above -> Admin -> 

## Add wiki pages 
* To add wiki pages you need to have a an account, and be logged in. 
* In the URL bar enter the URL for the page you'd like to create. For example the page `Config/Monitoring/test` you need to enter the url [/wiki/Config/Monitoring/test]
Wiki pages are currently configured to automatically use markdown syntax for any wiki page that starts with `Config`, `HPEBestPractice`, or `STAT`. 
This is set in `/opt/stat/system/conf/trac.ini`.

Optionally Markdown syntax can be used in other paths, and it tickets if surrounded by:
```
{{{#!Markdown
Content goes here
}}}
```

## Tickets 
Tickets can be logged either via the 'New Ticket' button above, or via the command line
Ticket fields, priorities etc. can all be set via the Admin menu above.

All Trac documentation, including a full guide to the ticketing system is included here: [[wiki:TracGuide]]
