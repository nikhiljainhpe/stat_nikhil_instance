## Security and /root
All system remote access will be done with user accounts, with sudo to root available on the adminÂ node for those that need it.

The root password will be periodically changed and any user ssh keys removed from /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on all nodes. 

Please use your home directories, directories under /root/hpe/ or ideally /tmp for files. 

__Please do not dump files in /root/__

use the following:

| Path              | Use                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
|/root/hpe/software | Any software uploaded to the system | 
|/root/hpe/disco    | Discovery files used/created        | 
|/root/hpe/users    | user dirs, create your own here     |
