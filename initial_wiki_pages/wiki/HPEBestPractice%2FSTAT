### Goal 
STAT is installed on the admin node and is intended to help system bringup and triage, by providing a central repository for system documentation, and an easy to use, easy to search interface for logging and tracking system issues and configuration tasks. 


While still in its infancy, STAT has executive sponsorship with the goal being fully productized to provide full system life-cycle component failure and repair history that can be fed back into the business, potentially integrate with Salesforce and streamline HPC system issue management. 


STAT has an easy to use web-interface and a couple of command line clients. 
i.e. you can log an issue as easily as:
```
tt tcreate -s \\"DIMM1A non-correctable error\\" -d \\"more detail here \\" -x x1001c0s0b0n0 -n nid1 -c Hardware-EX
```
and find all issues in a specific chassis with 
```
tt tquery xname~=x1001c0
```

There is also an editor based client `scon` 
see [wiki:STAT/Cartman]

Web access can be achieved via ssh port forwarding or proxying. 
Please reach out on slack if you need any help with this.
